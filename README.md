# ðŸ’¡ Story & Motivation
Back in College, I were swamped left and right with activities and projects, confusing me what and when to do activities.
So I created a Spreadsheet to monitor my activities and projects.

ðŸ“Š Activity Checker 
Activity Checker is a fully-automated productivity and task management spreadsheet built in Google Sheets. 
It helps you stay on top of your deadlines, track your progress by category, and get visual insights into your pending and completed tasks â€” all in one place.

Automatically calculates and updates the "Days Left" column every day at 12:00 AM.

ðŸ“… Upcoming & Overdue Tables
Displays:

Tasks due in the next 3 days
A list of overdue activities

ðŸ“‚ Smart Sorting & Filtering
Sort and filter tasks by:

Category (e.g., Course, Project, Birthday, Seminar)
Status (Done or Pending)
Due Date
And more!

ðŸ“ˆ Visual Dashboards
